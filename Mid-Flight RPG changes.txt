Changes made mid-flight:

A) Index.html
  1. Changed Player Stats button function from displayPlayerStats() >> rerollPlayerStats()
  2. Changed Restart button function from rerollPlayerStats() >> restartGame();
  3. Renamed Restart button element ID from "restart" >> "restart-button" (this follows naming convention of each other button)
  4. Renamed javascript.js in <script> section >> start-game.js
  5. Added damageDealt() to new button ("player-combat-button");
  6. Added three IDs: player-level, player-exp, and enemy-exp


B) stylesheet.css
  1. Created restart-button CSS (double-check the layout as "float: left;" may mess with other in-line elements)
  2. Combined declaration blocks so less messy/repetitious (saved code in case a bug occurs)
  3. Gathered #player-attribute declaration blocks together
  4. Moved #enemy-attribute declaration blocks together
  5. Created CSS button for player-combat-button
  6. Created declaration blocks for three IDs: player-level, player-exp, and enemy-exp

C) javascript.js
  1. Moved rerollPlayerStats() function to javascript.js file;
	1a. Want to rename javascript.js file to player file or start game file
  2. Renamed javascript.js >> start-game.js and corrected it on index.html
  3. updated playerOne to include two new key-pairs: level and experience

D) player.js
  1. Commented out function, but may move all player code to that page in future

E) damage.js
  1. Coded a damageDealt() function to kill enemies
    1a. Need to design exp gain system (add key/values to both player and enemies)
  2. Added code to gain exp (killing enemy grants exp)
    2a. Need to design how to store and calculate leveling up (new variable? Separate object?)

F) enemy.js
  1. Updated all enemies with exp key-pairs
  2. "Evil Troy and Evil Abed" should be first boss (?)
  3. Hardcoded remaining attributes for Bali Snake and Frenchmen (renamed "French Fucks" >> "Trevor's Frenchmen)
  4. Added exp to each enemy
  5. Should design system that looks at player exp level and switches from ENEMY array to BOSS array one time
    5a. After victory or defeat, switch back to ENEMY array, at maybe a higher-level enemy array
