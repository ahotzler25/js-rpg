A simple browser-based, javascript RPG testing/practicing concepts

<ul>
  <li>Major updates to functionality and some design over a few days' time</li>
  <li>Added player classes, damageReceived() and damageDealt() functions, but need to fix EXP system</li>
  <li>Looking to add class-specific abilities and stat changes as well as an inventory system</li>
  <li>After exp system is figured out (bug with how much exp gained), will look to implement boss fights</li>
